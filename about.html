    <h2>I love to make maps, it really is my passion in life. Here I will share one of my best with you!</h2>

    <img align: center; width="90%" src="images/WorldMap33.png" alt="A historical map of the world in the year 1933">
      <h6 align: left;>Made in Photoshop</h6>
    <p>As it said on the image, this is a historical map of the world in 1933 in my art style.</p>
    <p>Making maps of this scale is a labor of love, Creating this base map took me hours, and researching and drawing a whole earth's worth of borders isn't easy either.</p>

    <p>While map making is my chill out and sit down hobby, Smash is my more fast paced hobby.</p>
    <p>My resume is not that great, but I have wins on some of the River Valley's better players. Such as Davenport's FNS and Macomb's Chase DeWitt.</p>
    <p>My charactters of choice are Marth, Lucina, and Falco in Smash Ultimate, and Falco and Melee</p>
